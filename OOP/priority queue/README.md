In a priority queue, each item x has an associated priority y. <br/>
When items are removed, they must be removed from the highest to the lowest priority. <br/>
We will assume that 1 is the highest priority. <br/>
If two items have the same priority, the item that was inserted into the queue first must be removed first. <br/>
