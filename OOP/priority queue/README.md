In a priority queue, each item x has an associated priority y. <br/>
When items are removed, they must be removed from the highest to the lowest priority. <br/>
We will assume that 1 is the highest priority. <br/>
If two items have the same priority, the item that was inserted into the queue first must be removed first. <br/>
<br/>
For example, <br/>
Input                               Number of items removed                 You print
(5, 1), (7, 3), (8, 2), (4, 3)                     4                        5, 8, 7, 4
