In a Crazynacci Sequence, every number is the sum of the three previous ones. <br/>
However, the sequence resets every time the resulting number is lower than -150. <br/>
When that happens, the current element is i + 10, where i is the number of times the sequence was reset. <br/>

We will start the sequence with 0, -1, -2. <br/>
For example: <br/>
0, -1, -2, -3, -6, -11, -20, -37, -68, -125, 11, 12, -102, -79, 13, 14, -52, ...
